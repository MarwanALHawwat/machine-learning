here I want to share the project I have done which is urine sediments classification using the data:
"""
Urine sediment examination (USE) is one of the main tests used in the evaluation of diseases such as kidney, urinary, metabolic, and diabetes
and to determine the density and number of various cells in the urine. USE's manual microscopy is a labor-intensive and time-consuming, imprecise, subjective process.
Recently, automatic analysis of urine sediment has become inevitable in the medical field. In this study, 
we propose a dataset that can be used by artificial intelligence techniques to automatically identify particles in urine sediment images.
The data set consists of 8509 particle images obtained by examining the particles in the urine sediment obtained from 409 patients
from the Biochemistry Clinics of Elazig Fethi Sekin Central Hospital. 
Particle images are collected in 8 classes in total and these are Erythrocyte, Leukocyte, Epithelial, Bacteria, Yeast, Cylinders, Crystals, and others (sperm, etc.).

I used 3 diffrent pre-trained model and I apply several technics to try to evaluate
here is the project link to check:"""https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JaIQ_S-d3NpgMmH_nFuiyO8Dl7YT9TwF?usp=sharing"""
